/* Heap Configuration defines the type of Heap you want to use for the system (application + Stack)
* Only one Heap buffer will be allocated. This heap will be shared by the system and the stack through one manager (HeapMem, HeapMem+HeapTrack or OSAL)
* You can still decide to create several heaps if you want, but at least one heap needs to be created.
* The stack must have a Heap to run.
* The different Heap manager available are :
* OSAL HEAP: legacy Heap manager provided with all BLE sdk. By default, this Heap manager is used.
* HeapMem:  heap manager provided by TI-RTOS (see TI-RTOS user guide for properties)
* HeapTrack: module on top of HeapMem allowing an easy debugging of memory allocated through HeapMem.

* The heap manager to use is selected by setting  HEAPMGR_CONFIG to the corresponding value (see below)
* 0    = osal Heap manager, size is static.
* 0x80 = osal Heap manager, with auto-size: The remainning RAM (not used by the system) will be fully assign to the Heap.
* 1    = HeapMem with Static size
* 0x81 = HeapMem with auto-size. The remainning RAM (not used by the system) will be fully assign to the Heap.
* 2    = HeapTrack (with HeapMem) with fixe size
* 0x82 = HeapTrack (with HeapMem) with auto-size: The remainning RAM (not used by the system) will be fully assign to the Heap.
*
* If HEAPMGR_CONFIG is not defined, but the configuration file ble_stack_heap.cfg is used, then the value HEAPMGR_CONFIG = 0x80 is assumed.
* If HEAPMGR_CONFIG is not defined, and the file ble_stack_heap.cfg is not used, then the value HEAPMGR_CONFIG = 0x80 is assumed and the default Heap size will be 3072
* unless you define HEAPMGR_SIZE to a different value in the project option (0 meaning auto-size).
*
* From the configuration below, two #define will be created that will be used by the application to setup the Heap:
* #define HEAPMGR_SIZE
* #define HEAPMGR_CONFIG
* In order to use those define, this include line needs to be added: #include <xdc/cfg/global.h>
*
* In order for the auto-size Heap to work, the following symbol needs to be created by the linker:
*  heapStart
*  heapEnd
*

/* modification of HEAPMGR_CONFIG and HEAPMGR_SIZE value must be done inside the include file bellow (ble_stack_jheap.cfg) */
